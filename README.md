# sephora-makeup-review-summary

## Project Overview
This project analyzes over 50,000 Sephora product reviews to uncover customer sentiment and generate actionable insights for beauty brands. Using **transformer-based sentiment models** and **LLM-generated summaries**, the pipeline provides both quantitative metrics (sentiment distributions, trends, review volumes) and qualitative insights (pros and cons from customer language). The results help stakeholders better understand product performance, customer satisfaction, and brand reputation.

## Key Findings
- **Positive Sentiment Dominates**: A majority of products received highly positive reviews, highlighting strong customer satisfaction with popular brands.  
- **Recurring Pain Points**: Negative sentiment often clustered around product **consistency, pricing, and longevity** â€” issues that frequently appeared across multiple brands.  
- **Brand Differentiation**: Some brands showed strong consistency in positive sentiment, while others displayed wider variance, indicating uneven product performance within the brand portfolio.  
- **LLM-Generated Pros/Cons**: Summaries highlighted **common customer praise** (texture, packaging, quality) and **frequent complaints** (allergic reactions, poor shade range), enabling quick product health assessments without manually reading thousands of reviews.

## Recommendations
- **Product Development**: Address recurring customer complaints (e.g., longevity, shade inclusivity) to improve product adoption.  
- **Marketing Strategy**: Leverage LLM-generated pros to emphasize key product strengths in campaigns and customer communications.  
- **Customer Support**: Use aggregated cons to build proactive FAQs or support scripts, reducing churn and improving satisfaction.  
- **Competitive Benchmarking**: Track sentiment trends at both product and brand levels to identify competitive advantages or risks.
